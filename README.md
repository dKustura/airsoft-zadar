Airsoft Klub Zadar (eng. Airsoft Club Zadar) is a recreational non-profit organization started by a group of friends from [Zadar, Croatia][zadar-maps] who enjoy playing airsoft 🔫. We also like going for hikes ⛰️, camping 🏕️, cycling 🚲 , and many more activities 🚣.

This app is developed to share our adventures, updates to our gear, to organize and announce upcoming events and connect with our members and followers.
